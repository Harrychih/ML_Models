# Machine Learning Models

The Git repo contains most representative machine learning (deep learning) models implemented before.

They are mostly models that I have implemented in machine learning, data science courses homework and projects, and some of them are implemented by myself in the need of personal projects or interest. 


The repo now contains following models:

1. Logistic Regression with a simple binary dataset

2. Pytorch based Simple DenseNet, ConvNet, and improve ConvNet with image dataset

3. Clustering: K-means(lambda means) clustering and Agglomerative Clustering with dataset.
